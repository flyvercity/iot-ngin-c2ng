<p>Let us demonstrate a full cycle of running the service in this controlled lab environment.</p>

<p>First, we clone a clean version of the repository. This may take some time.</p> 

<break time="3s"/>

<p>Then, we initialize submodules containting <sub alias="exceeds">ExcID's</sub> Verifiable Credentials library and a signal acquisition tool developed from flight trials.</p>

<p>Next, we update the submodules.</p>

<break time="1s"/>

<p>Once the submodules are ready, we can build the service.</p>
