<p>To perform experimental flights, we chose a zone where we could fly safely and have a good 5G radio coverage. The flight trials were conducted in cooperation with our partner Skydrones, a company based in the U.K. A proper zone was identified in the outskirts of London, near De Havilland Aircraft Museum. 5G Non-Standalone network is deployed in the zone as well.</p>
<p>A multicopter platform was user for this trials, equipped with a 5G communications module based on a Telit modem and Frequency Range One antenna set.</p>
