Over the coming years, the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (a.k.a drones) will expand massively. Urban skies will become more and more packed with UAS, automatically delivering goods and services. it is envisioned that by 2030 almost 3 billion drone delivery flights will occur annually and this is 120 times more than the number of flights in aviation today.
