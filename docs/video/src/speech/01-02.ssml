Today, most drone flights are conducted in visual line-of-sight mode, in which the remote pilot maintains direct visibility with a drone in the sky. Remote pilots control trajectory and collision risks for drones using their eyes and simple direct radio links. Drone operations tomorrow will require much more sophisticated technologies to support mass automated flights beyond visual line-of-sight mode.
